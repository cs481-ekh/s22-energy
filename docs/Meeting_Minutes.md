## Sprint0 Retrospect
#### Group: Jack, Aidan, Keegan, Khaled, Taylor, Victor
<p>
I think the group worked really well together implementing sprint0.
Everyone was able to assist were needed and we did a greate job during our
meeting identifying what our task needed to be and who would handle each task.
I think the only thing I would change would be keeping better meeting
notes/descriptions to be added to our docs.
</p>

<p>
I also think our group did well with sprint 0. We're at kind of an awkard
stage of development where it can be hard to get meaningful and evenyl
distributed tasks for all 6 of us at once, but I foresee this getting better as
we begin true development.
</p>

<p>
The group did a great job implementing sprint0. Everybody was able compelete his task on time, as mentioned the only thing we need to do is to add more notes and descriptions to our docs.
</p>

<p>
We definetely succeeded in our goals this sprint, curious to see how real development will go.
Need to talk with sponsor about how to handle data. Overall I think we are set up to begin dev!

## 1/31/2022 - Sponsor Meeting
#### Attendees: Jack, Aidan, Keegan, Khaled, Taylor, Victor
<p>
  Meeting went well, spent about 45 minutes talking about expectations for this project, very excited! Here are some things we went over:
  
 * Simple map, 3D campus map overlay might be overkill
 * Ideally would prefer clickable buildings rather than pins (not crucial). Energy data shows up on card with a click.
 * Toggles/filters for electric, gas, geothermal?, solar, historical data (delimits by week/month/year?). (stretch goal: steam)
 * Requested sample data set (He will get .csv and sq. ft. of buildings BY Feb. 8
 * ABSOLUTE(Raw) Energy filter vs. EUI (energy usage intensity --> energy used divided by sq. ft. of building)
 * includes way to graph data like UC berkely energy website (perhaps google dashboard)
 * Potentially autofilling "real time" data from energy client (stretch goal)
 * Future check in meeting planned -> Monday, February 28 @ 12:30
 * Stretch goal: Automated data polling from BSU database for available energy's (alongsige csv upload for other
energies)
  
  Action Items: Finish project plan and get it to sponsor, Plan for future meeting, stay in contact with sponsor for any questions. Recieve .csv from sponsor
