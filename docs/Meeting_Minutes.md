## 1/31/2022 - Sponsor Meeting
#### Attendees: Jack, Aidan, Keegan, Khaled, Taylor, Victor
<p>
  Meeting went well, spent about 45 minutes talking about expectations for this project, very excited! Here are some things we went over:
  
 \n* Simple map, 3D campus map overlay might be overkill
  \n* Ideally would prefer clickable buildings rather than pins (not crucial). Energy data shows up on card with a click.
  \n* Toggles/filters for electric, gas, geothermal?, solar, historical data (delimites by week/month/year?). (stretch goal: steam)
  \n* Requested sample data set (He will get .csv and sq. ft. of buildings BY Feb. 8
  \n* ABSOLUTE(Raw) Energy filter vs. EUI (energy usage intensity --> energy used divided by sq. ft. of building)
  \n* includes way to graph data like UC berkely energy website (perhaps google dashboard)
  \n* Potentially autofilling "real time" data from energy client (stretch goal)
  \n* Future check in meeting planned
  Action Items: Finish project plan and get it to sponsor, Plan for future meeting, stay in contact with sponsor for any questions. Recieve .csv from sponsor

  Spent time discussing what question we should ask in our agenda meeting.  Created an outline of key points we wanted to bring up.

  the data format we will be recieving and showing our map examples of what we think we can do.  Also understanding what his vision might 
  be so we can discuss it.
