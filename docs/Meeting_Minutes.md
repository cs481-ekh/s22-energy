  Spent time discussing what question we should ask in our agenda meeting.  Created an outline of key points we wanted to bring up.  
  We want to also make sure the meeting is recorded so we can refrence it later, if needed.   Our main focus for tomorrow is understanding 
  the data format we will be recieving and showing our map examples of what we think we can do.  Also understanding what his vision might 
  be so we can discuss it.
