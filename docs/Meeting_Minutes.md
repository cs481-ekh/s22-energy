## Sprint1 Retrospect
#### Group: Jack, Aidan, Keegan, Khaled, Taylor, Victor

<p>
   We got done with all the tasks that we planned to do, 
   a lot of work was done to get the backend done. We had a serveral meetings during 
   the last two weeks and we had a lot of discussions, the backend might still need more work.  
   
   So we pretty much split into two groups on this sprint. 
   Once for backend and one to start up the front end. 
   I think that this sprint was successful because we achieved all 
   (or most) of the tasks that we set out to complete. We got 
   a good mockup of front end and are on the way to a working 
   backend! Work seemed well distributed and everyone was busy 
   with their tasks.
   
   I think there was a lot of collaboration between all members of our team.  We had several meetings that helped clear 
   up ideas we had.  I do feel like we could have spent some more time on each piece of the sprint.  We have discussed this 
   and next sprint we will spend a lot more time working on our task.  
   

   The sprint went well, we were able to accomplish all the tasks we set out to do. I think some of the tasks could have been tackled in Sprint 0 since 1/4
   of the tasks involved setting up and configuring different aspects of the project. This was mostly due to the fact that we hadn't analyzed the CSV data files
   enough beforehand and figured out how to tackle them. 
   
   Overall, I think everyone did a good job of getting their pieces done, but as others have said a lot of the work was done near the end of the sprint, rather
   than towards the beginning and middle. Given how much we were able to get done in that short period of time I am optimistic about what we can accomplish in
   Sprint 2.

   A good start to the development process for our project. The front end guys
   are doing a great job and the database guys are also doing great work
   getting the data mapped and ready to be useable. I personally didn't do
   enough on this Sprint (Taylor). I volunteered for a task that was originally
   going to be difficult and then we ended up changing our mind on how we
   wanted to do it. This made my task relatively easy, I need to make sure to
   get a heavier work load this next sprint so I can make a bigger impact.

<p>
   
   * Discussed spreadsheet/data issues.  Missing building codes and unknown address location(Jerome).  Had to determine what to do with this type of data.
   * Discussed Map API issue and our plan to use Bing Map API.  This could be a problem if BSU wants us to use Google API, would require a complete change to the application

## Sprint0 Retrospect
#### Group: Jack, Aidan, Keegan, Khaled, Taylor, Victor
<p>
I think the group worked really well together implementing sprint0.
Everyone was able to assist were needed and we did a greate job during our
meeting identifying what our task needed to be and who would handle each task.
I think the only thing I would change would be keeping better meeting
notes/descriptions to be added to our docs.
</p>

<p>
I also think our group did well with sprint 0. We're at kind of an awkard
stage of development where it can be hard to get meaningful and evenyl
distributed tasks for all 6 of us at once, but I foresee this getting better as
we begin true development.
</p>

<p>
The group did a great job implementing sprint0. Everybody was able compelete his task on time, as mentioned the only thing we need to do is to add more notes and descriptions to our docs.
</p>

<p>
We definetely succeeded in our goals this sprint, curious to see how real development will go.
Need to talk with sponsor about how to handle data. Overall I think we are set up to begin dev!

## 1/31/2022 - Sponsor Meeting
#### Attendees: Jack, Aidan, Keegan, Khaled, Taylor, Victor
<p>
  Meeting went well, spent about 45 minutes talking about expectations for this project, very excited! Here are some things we went over:
  
 * Simple map, 3D campus map overlay might be overkill
 * Ideally would prefer clickable buildings rather than pins (not crucial). Energy data shows up on card with a click.
 * Toggles/filters for electric, gas, geothermal?, solar, historical data (delimits by week/month/year?). (stretch goal: steam)
 * Requested sample data set (He will get .csv and sq. ft. of buildings BY Feb. 8
 * ABSOLUTE(Raw) Energy filter vs. EUI (energy usage intensity --> energy used divided by sq. ft. of building)
 * includes way to graph data like UC berkely energy website (perhaps google dashboard)
 * Potentially autofilling "real time" data from energy client (stretch goal)
 * Future check in meeting planned -> Monday, February 28 @ 12:30
 * Stretch goal: Automated data polling from BSU database for available energy's (alongsige csv upload for other
energies)
  
  Action Items: Finish project plan and get it to sponsor, Plan for future meeting, stay in contact with sponsor for any questions. Recieve .csv from sponsor
